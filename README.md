This repository contains the scripts, modules and plotting notebooks for the paper "Landscape and environmental heterogeneity stabilize competitive metacommunities"

`modules/` folder contains the prerequisite functions to run the scripts. Needed packages in the Python environment are in the requirements.txt

`scripts/` folder contains the important scripts: 
- to generate the stationary population densities of a metacommunity for a range of environmental heterogeneities
- to simulate beyond mean-field networks at different environmental heterogeneities
- to simulate metapopulations on Random Geometric Graph (RGG) and Optimal Channel Network (OCN)

`notebooks/` folder contains different notebooks for the different panels of the figures plotted in the paper

`data/` folder contains all the data generated from the scripts used for plotting in the notebooks. It has been compressed for uploading purposes. Please decompress before running notebooks
